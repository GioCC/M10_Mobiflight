Draft: handling of M10Board objects
===================================

MF config:
- hardwired in the manager board, not changeable

Board class:
- ADD: inject CB for Input events (static methods) (DI, Encoders)
- Check LCDCTRL delayed init
- Change _MCPIO1/_MCPIO2 to MCPIO[]; (construction with placement new like LED/LCD?)

Board config data:
- ADD PIN ASSIGNMENT / (addresses) FOR LED/LCD/MCPIO TO CONFIG! (different for each board!!!)
- try to not keep copy in RAM for every board (maybe just 1 buffer object in RAM used during setup, shared).
  See TODO about PROGMEM reference
- Check specification of correct size for _DISP[]

Board config methods:
- Used practically only by the setBoardCfg() function

Digital I/Os:
- Storage for values: Internal
- DI: 'Bank<x>' objects unnecessary? 
    - Value buffering and event raise done during polling (In) or value setting (out); 
- DO: 'Bank<x>' probably required. MF commands write to the buffer, buffer written immediately or during poll (even if SPI, can't read/write at the same time)
- Board local I/O address <-> Global I/O address: possibly straightforward (e.g. GA = LA + baseOffset[Board#])
- After polling, function call for internal business specific to the board:
  Function or method (=> subclassing)?
  
LED displays:
- messages forwarded almost without change, except possibly internal business logic

LCD displays:
- messages forwarded almost without change, except possibly internal business logic
